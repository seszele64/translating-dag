To accomplish the tasks outlined in your project—fetching documents, translating them using the DeepL API, adjusting the content with an LLM, and correcting errors—you'll need a well-structured codebase. Here's a suggested structure that separates concerns and makes the code easier to maintain and extend:

```
project-root/
│
├── docs/                   # Documentation files
│   └── README.md           # Project description and usage guide
│
├── src/                    # Source code
│   ├── main.py             # Main application script
│   │
│   ├── fetcher.py          # Module for fetching documents
│   │
│   ├── translator.py       # Module for translating documents using DeepL API
│   │
│   ├── adjuster.py         # Module for adjusting content with LLM
│   │
│   └── corrector.py        # Module for correcting errors
│
├── tests/                  # Test cases
│   ├── test_fetcher.py     # Tests for fetcher module
│   ├── test_translator.py  # Tests for translator module
│   ├── test_adjuster.py    # Tests for adjuster module
│   └── test_corrector.py   # Tests for corrector module
│
└── requirements.txt        # List of dependencies
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

- **docs/**: Contains all documentation files, starting with the `README.md`. This is where users and contributors find information about the project.
- **src/**: Holds the source code of the project, organized into modules based on functionality.

  - **main.py**: The entry point of the application. It orchestrates the workflow by calling functions from other modules in sequence.
  - **fetcher.py**: Responsible for fetching documents from various sources. This module abstracts the details of how documents are retrieved.
  - **translator.py**: Utilizes the DeepL API to translate the fetched documents. It handles API calls and translates the content accordingly.
  - **adjuster.py**: Applies adjustments to the translated content using an LLM. This module focuses on refining the text for better readability and fluency.
  - **corrector.py**: Identifies and corrects errors in the adjusted content. This includes grammatical, syntactical, and contextual errors.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for each module. Writing tests ensures that changes to the code do not break existing functionality.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all external libraries and tools required to run the project. This helps in setting up the development environment easily.

### Additional Notes:

- **Modularity**: Each module should be independent and focused on a single responsibility. This design principle makes the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling within each module to manage potential issues gracefully, such as network errors when accessing the DeepL API or parsing errors in the documents.
- **Configuration**: Consider using configuration files or environment variables to manage settings like API keys, URLs, and other parameters that might change between environments (development, testing, production).

This structure is just a suggestion and can be adapted based on the specific needs of your project and personal preferences.
