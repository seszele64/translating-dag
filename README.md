# Updated Project README

## Overview

This project automates the process of fetching, translating, adjusting, and correcting documents using a combination of APIs and advanced language models. It leverages the free and open DeepL API endpoint provided by OwO Network for translations. The workflow is designed to enhance document quality and accuracy through several key steps.

## Workflow

1. **Fetch Contents**: Documents are retrieved from a specified source, which could be a local directory, a cloud storage service, or any other accessible location.
2. **Translate Using DeepL API**: The fetched documents are translated using the DeepL API provided by OwO Network. This step converts the content into the desired language, ensuring clarity and accessibility.
3. **Adjust Using LLM (Large Language Model)**: Following translation, the content undergoes adjustments through a Large Language Model (LLM). This step refines the text, making it more natural and fluent in the target language.
4. **Correct Errors**: The final step involves identifying and correcting any grammatical, syntactical, or contextual errors introduced during the translation and adjustment processes.

### Technologies Used

- **DeepL API (OwO Network)**: For translating documents between languages. [DeepL API Documentation](https://deeplx.owo.network/endpoints/free.html)
- **LLM API**: For refining and adjusting the translated content. The specific implementation details will depend on the chosen LLM platform.

## Adjustments Made

During the adjustment phase, the LLM focuses on several aspects to improve the overall quality of the translated documents:

- **Errors**: Identifying and correcting any inaccuracies in the translated text.
- **Grammar**: Ensuring that the grammar is correct and consistent throughout the document.
- **Syntax**: Adjusting the syntax to make the text flow naturally and readably.

## Getting Started

To begin with this project, ensure you have access to the DeepL API provided by OwO Network. Follow the setup instructions for obtaining the necessary API keys and configuring your environment.

## Usage

After setting up, you can use the provided scripts or develop custom solutions to integrate the workflow into your document management system. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy customization and integration.
